### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**NezaShalom/NezaShalom** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Frontier
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning BlockChain
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to push the envelope a little bit.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about ReactJs or any tech related stuff
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: @IG_Charm
- âš¡ Fun fact: Music is my kickstart for the day.
